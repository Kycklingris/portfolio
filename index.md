Deck Of Haunts at it's core is a roguelike deckbuilder. It was my ~8 month long internship during my studies at Futuregames. My work mainly consisted of card related systems, and the cards themselves, but due to the smaller team size I also worked on various other features as well.
- Working with **C++** in **Unreal Engine 5**
- **Plastic SCM** for versioning
- The system for the cards
- Many of the cards
- Debug menu

Currently my main personal project with a focus on development tools for the use of modding. It is a multi faceted project that requires work in backend, frontend and game development. So far, I have mostly been working on the system for controlling the frontend from godot in a simple and flexible way. The project has changed scope and goals a number of times. As it is a game that I wish to release at some point I am not comfortable with having the source public, although I would happily show more in a private setting.
- Backend built with **Axum**, **Rust**, **CoTURN**, **Docker** and **Redis** (previously ASP.NET Core)
- Frontend built with **Typescript**, **Lit** and **XState**
- Host game built with **Godot** and **C++**, I will be using **GDScript** for the gameplay code
- **Git** for versioning

There isn't all that much to show currently. I am currently not doing any work on this as I ended up spending more time on managing gpu resources than rendering techniques. If I decide to take it up again, I will most likely be doing work on top of an existing rendering engine such as Bevy.
- Working with **Rust** and **WGPU**
- **Git** for versioning
- Soft shadows
- Currently a lot of light leak
- Compute shader per triangle scanline based voxelization
- Voxel rendering for debugging

B34-N is an online multiplayer top-down cooperative shooter. 
This was my second group game project at Futuregames, and can only be described as a failure. However, due to the unique aspect of online multiplayer I feel it is worth showcasing.

- **Git** for versioning
- Online networking using the **Mirror** library
