# Networking
Two windows of the same game playing together.

The networking was implemented using the [Mirror](https://mirror-networking.com/) library as well as [Mono.Nat](https://github.com/alanmcgovern/Mono.Nat) for upnp. 

Most of the networking code was either written by me or partially written by me.

The networking does work as it should in the end product with no major bugs, the game ends for both players when one quits, HUD (mostly done by another) and lobby UI is synced, there is local network server discovery although without any meta data, as such it shows up as just a IP address.

# Throwable healing field
{% include preload_img.html

%}

A mostly reusable throwable item, that in this case heals the player in a radius upon landing. It has a guide line showing where it will land. 

The landing position is calculated rather cruedly, first raycasting from the pointer location on the screen to check if the player is pointing onto ground, as well as get the direction and distance from the player; if the distance is lower than the max allowed distance just use the first raycast hit, otherwise raycast up and down from a point calculated using the max distance and the direction previously gathered. 

# Minor contributions

 - Implemented FMOD (audio) events.
 - Implementation of animation blend tree for single shot and continuous shooting, separate leg and body animations, throw animation, dash and hacking animations.
 - "Hacking" ability.
   - Also uses an interface.
